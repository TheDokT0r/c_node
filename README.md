# c_node
Just a small project that I've made in c cause I was bored

## Compiling
In order to compile the app, all you have to do is to run the build.sh script like so:
```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

In order to run the compiled binary, all you have to do is to run the following command:
```bash
./c_node
```
