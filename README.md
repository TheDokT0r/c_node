# c_node
Just a small project that I've made in c cause I was bored

## Compiling
In order to compile the app, you'll need to have just and gcc installed on your machine. You should then be able to compile the app with the following command:
```bash
just build
```

Or with the following command if you'd like to create a static binary:
```bash
just build-static
```
In order to run the compiled binary, all you have to do is to run the following command:
```bash
./c_node
```
